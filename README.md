Solving modified TSP problem using metaheuristics and evolutionary algorithms. 

Implemented:
* Nearest neighbor heuristic
* Greedy cycle
* k-regret heuristic
* Local search: steepest and greedy, with candidate moves
* Iterated local search with perturbations
* Multiple start local search
* Hybrid-evolutionary algorithm
